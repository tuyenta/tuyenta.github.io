Copyrights of the papers on this page belong to the publishers. What this means is that publishing houses get to overcharge research institutions and universities for access to their employees’ research (which was carried out, reviewed and edited with no cost to the publishers), but they are gracious enough to allow authors to keep a preprint for personal use...

My author pages on arXiv and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n1YQUZMAAAAJ) can be found here and there respectively. You can also find a list of publications organized by topic here. If you’re wondering about the numbering scheme, “S” means software, “W” is for working/submitted papers, “J” for journals, and “C” for international conference proceedings.
